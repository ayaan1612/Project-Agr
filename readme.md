# Smart Agriculture: Viksit Bharat 2047

![Smart Agriculture Platform]

## About the Project

Smart Agriculture is an interactive 3D agricultural recommendation platform designed to empower Indian farmers with data-driven insights. This project aligns with the vision of **Viksit Bharat 2047** (Developed India 2047) by leveraging technology to transform agriculture - one of India's most crucial economic sectors.

By 2047, when India celebrates 100 years of independence, this platform contributes to the national goal of creating a self-reliant, technologically advanced agricultural sector that ensures food security, economic prosperity, and sustainable practices.

## Key Features

- **Interactive 3D Soil Visualizations**: Explore different soil types common in India with realistic 3D models
- **Seasonal Recommendations**: Get customized crop suggestions based on growing seasons (Kharif, Rabi, Summer)
- **Crop Compatibility Analysis**: Find the perfect match between your soil type and potential crops
- **Sustainability Insights**: Learn best practices for sustainable farming specific to your soil and season
- **Educational Resources**: Access comprehensive information about cultivation practices, water management, and more

## How to Use

The Smart Agriculture platform guides you through a simple 3-step process:

### 1. Select Your Soil Type
- Choose from six common Indian soil types: Alluvial, Black, Red, Laterite, Desert, and Mountain soil
- View detailed 3D models that help visualize soil composition and properties
- Learn about each soil type's characteristics, pH levels, and natural distribution

### 2. Select the Growing Season
- Choose from three main growing seasons in India: Kharif (monsoon), Rabi (winter), or Summer
- Each season has unique visualizations showing rainfall and temperature patterns
- Understand how seasonal conditions affect crop growth in your selected soil

### 3. View Crop Recommendations
- Receive personalized crop recommendations based on your soil and season selection
- Each recommendation includes:
  - Crop suitability score
  - Expected yield potential
  - Cultivation requirements
  - Water and nutrient needs
  - Market value information

### Knowledge Hub
- Access the knowledge hub anytime to get in-depth information about:
  - Soil composition and management
  - Season-specific cultivation techniques
  - Sustainable farming practices
  - Water conservation methods
  - Modern agricultural practices

## Technical Details

This platform is built using:
- **Streamlit**: For the interactive web interface
- **Plotly**: For data visualization and 3D models
- **Python**: For the recommendation engine and data processing
- **Lottie Animations**: For engaging visual elements

## Contribution to Viksit Bharat 2047

This project supports India's vision for 2047 by:

1. **Promoting Agricultural Efficiency**: Helping farmers make data-driven crop selection decisions
2. **Digital Transformation**: Bringing advanced technology to agricultural planning
3. **Climate Adaptation**: Preparing farmers for seasonal variations and climate change
4. **Rural Prosperity**: Enhancing farm yields and economic outcomes
5. **Sustainable Development**: Encouraging eco-friendly farming practices

## Vision for the Future

As we move toward Viksit Bharat 2047, this platform will evolve to include:
- Integration with real-time weather data
- Soil sensing technology integration
- AI-powered crop disease detection
- Marketplace connections for farmers
- Community knowledge sharing
